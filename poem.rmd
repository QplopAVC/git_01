In realms where numbers softly blend,  
Statistics begins to wend.  
  
Data points like stars align,  
In patterns clear, their stories shine.  
  
Mean, the center, holds its ground,  
Median’s balance, evenly found.  
  
Mode, the frequent, makes its mark,  
In the data’s quiet arc.  
  
Standard deviation whispers wide,  
How data spreads from side to side.  
  
Charts and graphs with colors bold,  
Visual tales of trends unfold.  
  
Regression curves predict the way,  
Forecasting futures, come what may.  
  
Hypotheses in tests collide,  
P-values guide the choice of side.  
  
Through sampling, insights take their flight,  
From randomness to order’s light.  
  
In statistics, every figure sings,  
A symphony of what data brings.
